# Present Projects

This document is intended to be a relatively current list of what various members of the lab are working on, so people can keep track, know who to talk to, etc. And to force you all to get practice using GitHub.

### Matt Mietchen
#### Current Projects:

* Project 1: PetNet
Disease transmission and colonization between companion animals and their owners may contribute to infection rates in both animal and human hospitals within a community. 

Objectives:
1. Complete literature review regarding MRSA or other pathogen transmission between companion animals and their owners
2. Identify and describe parameters that fit a dog into a family structure
    * PetNet will initially focus on canine companion animals only
    
* Project 2: Metapopulation Model (Reduced Nurse-Patient Ratio)
Reduce current metapop model to only have 12 nurses and 6 patients (or a 2:1 ratio)
    * 2017 BUGG study (Harris et al. J Hosp Infect 2017 Appendix) had this ratio regardless of the size of the hospital. In addition, it seems there might be several states that have laws restricting the number of ICU patients per nurse.

Increase the number of physicians from one to two
    * The idea behind this is to represent a more realistic number of physicians interacting with patients on a daily basis.

#### Papers in Progress (and Status):
* "Population Structure Drives Differential Methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus<I> Colonization Dynamics"
        * Status: Currently under review with <I>PLOS<I> Computational Biology
