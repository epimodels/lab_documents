# 3D Printing Notes and Documentation

This document serves as a record and notekeeping document for the Lofgren Lab's Lulzbot Taz Workhorse 3D printer. If you have questions about it's use, requests for filament samples, project ideas, etc. please come talk to Dr. Lofgren.

## Printer Notes

Current Printer Status: Down for Repairs (Y-axis Timing Belt is broken)


## Filament Notes

There are swatches of most filaments we have used in Dr. Lofgren's office, in the grey box aptly marked "Filament Swatches". Note this does not guarentee that we have any particular one of these filaments "in stock", merely that we have successfully printed with it in the past. For a more realistic look at how the filament prints, there are small octopus prints scattered throughout the Allen School. Matching a swatch to an octopus is left as an exercise for the reader.
